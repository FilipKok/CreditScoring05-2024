# CreditScoring05-2024
This project is about creating Credit Scoring Models based on on Home Credit data published on Kaggle.

All of the source files are in the link below: https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data

7 files in csv format:
- application_train.csv
- bureau.csv
- bureau_balance.csv
- credit_card_balance.csv
- previous_application.csv
- installments_payments.csv

Here is also the columns description: 
HomeCredit_columns_description.csv


To prepare the data, I used Python and Statistica software with the'Scoring Set' addition. 
Statistica software was also used to create the models and they are located on a private local disk, but here I also make public the machine learning models that are used to compare these models.
